# PyDE

A personal portfolio of Python data engineering projects.

## Overview

This repository contains a growing collection of standalone projects and code samples that demonstrate my work with Python for data engineering. Each project is organized into its own folder with:

- Code (scripts, notebooks, modules)  
- Documentation (README, comments)  
- Any required configuration or dependency files  

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/PyDE.git
   cd PyDE
   ```
2. Create & activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Enter any project folder and install its dependencies, e.g.:
   ```bash
   cd project-folder
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure

- Each top-level directory is a standalone project.  
- New projects will be added over time as I explore different data engineering challenges.  

## Notes

- This is my personal workspace and portfolio.  
- Feel free to browse, fork, or run any project that interests you!
